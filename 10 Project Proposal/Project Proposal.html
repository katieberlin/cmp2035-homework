Though the implementation of this plan is a little further in the future, I want to build a website that allows me to display all of my artwork that I feel people would like to see. One of my friends and I both love designing, and at some point we’d like to start a small business selling them. For the purpose of this project, I’m going to build the website displaying only my personal artwork (for the sake of time) and use it as a template to add hers later on. Then eventually, once I feel I’ve built up and updated the website enough, we’re going to try and implement a business plan for selling certain designs. 

The website will include a variety of content, so different designs will be grouped by type. Some sections would include photography, stencils, jewelry, paintings, sketches, etc. This way, people wouldn’t necessarily have to go to the website solely to shop, they’d also be able to just browse around the various categories and look at art and designs for their own sake. If they happened to really like a certain one, there would be the option to inquire and/or purchase, but that won’t be the sole purpose of the website’s existence.

My friend and I will both try and update the website as frequently as possible in order to monitor people’s interactions and reactions to the website and its content. The main page of the website should just be the home page, introducing/explaining a little bit about us and what we do. The navigational bar would include drop down menu options of the various artwork and designs available to view or purchase.  The system for how people contact us to purchase an item will probably work a little different than if a person were to email one of us directly. At this point however, I’m going to try and build the feature so that an email gets sent to me when a person submits a message through a request form. There will be a space to put the item number and other details. Then we will ship out the orders as they come in, and figure out the rest as we go.
